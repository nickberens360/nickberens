<p class="intro">I really enjoy writing HTML, CSS and Javascript. I'm always trying to balance writing clean semantic HTML with, "holy crap, you need this done by when?". I work at an agency and  sometimes best practices just take a backseat to deadlines. Far too often the code in my work examples are littered with divs that should be section or article tags. I throw classes around like my life depends on it. I know this is wrong and I'm working on it, honestly I am.</p>
			
<p>I try my best to write CSS that is modular and portable. I keep poking around Johnathan Snook's book on Scalable Modular Architecture for CSS. Right now I'm just trying to figure it out myself. I think the best way to learn something is to do it wrong first, so you know why the right way is indeed the right way.</p>
<p>I really enjoy Javascript and jQuery. I am really bad Javascript and jQuery. I am just learning the language (and programming in general), so everything I write is this inefficient trainwreck. I'm just not there yet. </p>
<p>Design is fun, but it's not my passion. I don't like that I can't really Google my way out of a design problem like I can with a code problem. It's too personal, I get sad when someone doesn't like my work. I don't mind doing a little bit or design here or there, but to do it as a fulltime gig, no thanks.</p>
<p>So this site and it's work examples are a snapshot of where I am at right now. I know my shortcomings and am always striving to improve.</p>
